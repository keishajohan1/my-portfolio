# Portfolio Website Project Rules

## Project Context
Building a professional portfolio website that mirrors LinkedIn profile information.

## Required Sections
1. Hero/Landing with profile photo, name, headline, CTAs
2. Projects showcase (minimum 3 projects with cards)
3. Skills section with animated progress bars
4. Contact section with social links
5. Responsive navigation

## Data Source
All content pulled from src/data/portfolioData.js - never hardcode content in components.

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind utility classes only
- Consistent padding: py-16 md:py-24 for sections
- Container: max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4

# Portfolio Color Scheme

## Brand Colors (MUST USE THESE EXACT VALUES)
- Primary: #055742 (deep teal - main brand color)
- Accent: #590F00 (burgundy - CTAs and highlights)
- Secondary: #172EB1 (royal blue - links and interactive elements)
- Background: #FFFFFF (white - main background)
- Light Background: #DADFE1 (light gray - alternating sections)

## Usage Guidelines
- Hero section: Gradient from #055742 to #172EB1
- CTA buttons: #590F00 with hover effect
- Section backgrounds: Alternate between #FFFFFF and #DADFE1
- Text on dark: #FFFFFF
- Text on light: #1a1a1a
- Links: #172EB1 with #590F00 hover

## Tailwind Config
Update tailwind.config.js with these exact colors.

## Component Requirements
- Every component must be responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Use useScrollAnimation hook for scroll-triggered animations
- All images must have alt text
- All external links open in new tab (target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer")

## Performance
- Lazy load images
- Minimize re-renders
- Use proper React keys in lists
- No console.log in production code
